# Are Educational Institutions Actually Period-Friendly?  
*A Reality Check*

---

## Introduction: Why This Matters

Imagine this: You’re a 14-year-old girl sitting in class when suddenly, you feel that familiar cramp. Your stomach twists, and you realize that your period has started. You glance around nervously.  
Do the toilets have doors that lock?  
Is there a pad available if you need one?  
Will someone laugh if they see you carrying your bag to the bathroom?  



For millions of girls in India, this isn’t just an occasional worry—it’s a monthly reality that affects their **education, health, and self-esteem**.

We’ve all heard about government schemes and awareness campaigns promising *"period-friendly"* schools and colleges.  

But what’s the real situation? Let’s break it down without sugarcoating.

---

## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: What’s Really Happening?

### 1. "Free Pads in our Institution!" – But Are They Actually There?

**What’s Supposed to Happen:**  
Government schools are meant to provide free sanitary pads under the Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS).  

**What Actually Happens:**  
- Pads arrive irregularly—sometimes once in three months, sometimes never.  
- In private institutions? Forget free pads. Most don’t even have a vending machine.  

---

### 2. The Great Indian Toilet Crisis

**What’s Supposed to Happen:**  
Every school should have clean, functional toilets with water, soap, and pad disposal.  

**What Actually Happens:**  
- No doors, no water, no soap.  
- In co-ed schools, girls avoid using toilets because boys peek or mock them.  
- With no dustbins, girls either flush pads (clogging pipes) or carry used ones back home.  

---

### 3. "Periods Are Natural!" – Then Why Do We Whisper About Them?

**What’s Supposed to Happen:**  
Schools should teach about menstruation openly and scientifically.  

**What Actually Happens:**  
- Girls are secluded for period lessons, boys are left clueless.  
- Many girls don’t know what a period is until they get theirs.  
- Myths thrive: *“Don’t pray during periods”*, *“Don’t touch pickles”*, *“Period blood is dirty.”*

### 4. "Just Take a Paracetamol and Sit in Class"

**What’s Supposed to Happen:**  
Girls should be allowed rest, pain relief, or a day off if needed.  

**What Actually Happens:**  
- Most schools don’t allow period leave.  
- Girls skip school secretly due to severe pain.  

---

### 5. Hide Your Pad Like It’s a Drug Deal

**What’s Supposed to Happen:**  
Periods should be normalized—no shame, no hiding.  

**What Actually Happens:**  
- Girls sneak pads like they’re doing something illegal.  
- Boys mock, snicker, or even take photos of leaks.  
- In villages, girls are isolated during periods.

## Period Negligence in Educational Institutions: Case Studies

**Case Study 1:**  
A Class 11 student in Bareilly was forced to stand outside her exam hall for an hour for asking for a sanitary pad—a basic necessity.  
This reflects how India’s education system criminalizes natural bodily functions.  
Until every institution implements proper menstrual policies, this will remain routine.  
**Case Study 2:**  
A college in Delhi has washrooms with broken doors, no water, and overflowing dustbins.  
For menstruating students, it’s a monthly nightmare that strips away dignity.  

---

## Why This Gap Exists: Root Causes

- **Deep-rooted shame** — Passed down by teachers and parents.  
- **Broken promises** — Government schemes fail due to corruption and poor monitoring.  
- **Systemic neglect** — Schools prioritize sports grounds over menstrual needs.  

Worst of all?  
We’ve normalized this. Girls accept humiliation as fate.

---

## The Solution Isn’t Complicated:

- Train **all staff** on menstrual sensitivity.  
- Audit and publicly report school facilities.  
- **Include boys** in period education.  

Until we treat menstrual dignity as seriously as math scores, we’re failing half our students. **Period.**

---

## So… What Can We Actually Do About It?

- Working toilets with **water and locks** — why is this still a luxury?  
- Educate **everyone** (yes, boys too).  
- Let girls rest if they’re in pain.  
- Talk openly. Share stories. Normalize periods.  
- Call out period-shaming. Don’t laugh, speak up.

## Titli’s Take

Are our educational institutions really period-friendly, or is it just performative progress?  

At **Titli**, we believe period dignity is non-negotiable.  
It’s time to move beyond symbolic gestures and prioritize real needs—because when institutions ignore menstrual health, they ignore the students living through it.
