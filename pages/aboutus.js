              At Titli Foundation, we empathize with the challenges faced by
              underprivileged menstruators when it comes to having a safe and
              hygienic period. We aim to provide them with sustainable menstrual
              products and raise awareness about menstrual hygiene and its safe
              practices.

              What started out as a will to help a few in need, turned out to be
              the biggest responsibility of my life. Sometimes I look back and
              wonder, it really did take just one step to change the lives of
              many.
              <br />
              We often think about bringing the change, revolutionizing society,
              but then all of it just comes down to â€“ "I can't change the
              world." The fact is, we don't need to change the world, we need to
              change ourselves.
              <br />
              Just initiating a conversation around menstruation speaks volumes
              of how willing you are to bring a change; and thatâ€™s what Titli is
              all about.
