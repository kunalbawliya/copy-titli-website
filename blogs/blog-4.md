## The Leaky Ceiling: Why This Matters

Imagine working through severe cramps, fatigue, or nausea while pretending everything is fine. This is the reality for three out of four people who menstruate, forced to push through pain because workplaces rarely acknowledge their needs.

But this isn’t just a personal struggle; it’s a productivity and health issue. Working in pain leads to more mistakes, burnout, and long-term health consequences. The impact extends beyond cisgender women; trans men and nonbinary colleagues often face additional stigma when discussing periods.

Change is coming. Courts in some countries are beginning to recognize severe menstrual pain as a legitimate workplace concern, requiring accommodations. The bottom line? Supporting menstrual health isn’t just about fairness. It’s about helping everyone perform better and stay healthier.

## What Real Support Looks Like

While free tampons in bathrooms are a nice gesture, they don’t address the real challenges of cramps, fatigue, or brain fog. True workplace support requires meaningful solutions:
- Allowing remote work or adjusted hours can make a huge difference for someone struggling with pain.
- Many leaders don’t know how to respond when an employee asks for period-related accommodations. Education is key.
- Support must include Trans men, nonbinary employees, and those going through menopause. Period stigma affects everyone differently.
- If people fear judgment, they won’t use available resources. A culture of openness is essential.

## A Practical Approach to Workplace Support

A supportive menstrual policy acknowledges this reality with practical accommodations that benefit both employees and employers.

### Key Components of an Effective Policy:
1.  **Flexible Work Arrangements**
    - Option to work remotely on days with severe symptoms.
    - Adjusted start times when needed.
    - Temporary reduction in physically demanding tasks.
2.  **Health Leave Provisions**
    - 3-5 designated health days per year (separate from sick leave).
    - No requirement for medical documentation.
    - Discretionary use for those who need it.
3.  **Workplace Amenities**
    - Menstrual products readily available in all restrooms.
    - Access to pain relief medication (upon request).
    - Designated rest areas for employees experiencing discomfort.

### Business Benefits:
- Reduced presenteeism and improved productivity.
- Enhanced employee retention and satisfaction.
- Demonstration of commitment to employee wellbeing.

This approach moves beyond symbolic gestures to create real impact. By implementing these practical measures, organizations can foster a productive work environment without jeopardizing someone's health.

## Global Lessons: Who’s Getting It Right

Several countries are leading the way in menstrual health policies:
- Japan (since 1947), South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Zambia, and Spain (the first in Europe, 2023) have laws allowing menstrual leave. Policies vary, whereas Spain offers 3–5 paid days, while South Korea provides 1 unpaid day.
- Some Indian states (Bihar), Chinese provinces, and companies like Zomato and Byju’s have adopted menstrual leave independently.
- Portugal grants paid leave for endometriosis/adenomyosis, and Vietnam allows 30-minute daily breaks during periods.

## Corporate Leaders: Who Gets It?

A growing number of businesses, especially in India, are implementing menstrual leave policies:
- Zomato: 10 paid days per year.
- Byju’s: 12 paid days per year.
- Swiggy: 2 days per month for delivery partners.
- L&T & Acer: 1 day per month.

These policies emphasize paid leave and flexibility, ensuring both office and field staff are supported.

## The Undeniable Business Case for Menstrual Policies

Menstrual health policies aren’t just about being progressive; they’re a smart financial decision. The numbers tell a compelling story that no bottom-line-focused executive can ignore.

Recent research reveals that 88% of menstruating employees experience work disruption due to their periods. That’s nearly 9 out of every 10 women and menstruating people in your workforce struggling with pain, fatigue, or brain fog while trying to meet deadlines. Even more startling? About 20% miss 1-2 workdays every menstrual cycle because their symptoms are so severe.

In the UK alone, when employees push through and come to work in pain, they operate at just 67% of their normal capacity. Over a year, this "presenteeism" adds up to nearly nine lost workdays per employee—a silent productivity drain most companies don’t even measure.

Forward-thinking companies are already reaping the benefits. When Zomato introduced its period leave policy, it saw a 17% reduction in female attrition within a year. That’s nearly one-fifth fewer women quitting—a huge win in retention savings alone.

Today, 70% of employees at companies with menstrual policies report higher job satisfaction. And with 64% of Gen Z candidates now actively checking for menstrual support when evaluating employers, these policies have become a powerful recruitment tool.

Here’s what executives need to hear: Implementing basic menstrual support costs less than 0.2% of annual payroll. The return? Most organizations see 2-3 times their investment back through reduced absenteeism, higher productivity, lower turnover, and stronger employer branding.

This isn’t about politics or being "woke” it’s cold, hard business logic. Companies without menstrual policies are:
1. Paying for lost productivity they don’t even track.
2. Losing talent to competitors who offer better support.
3. Missing an easy win for employee engagement.

The question isn’t "Can we afford to do this?" it’s "Can we afford not to?"

## How Workplaces Can Make Change Happen

Here’s how companies can take meaningful action:
- Train staff on menstrual health and frame support as a standard health policy, not "special treatment."
- Offer flexibility. Remote work, adjusted hours, or temporary role changes can be more practical than a strict "period leave" policy.
- Provide amenities. Stock free menstrual products in restrooms and offer private rest areas with heating pads.
- Be inclusive. Policies must explicitly cover trans men, nonbinary, and peri-menopausal employees.
- Gather feedback. Anonymously track policy usage and survey employees to refine support over time.

## Key Takeaways

Menstrual health is a workplace issue, and ignoring it hurts both employees and businesses. Progressive companies and countries are already proving that supportive policies lead to healthier, more productive teams. The next step is normalizing the conversation, removing shame, and making menstrual accommodations as standard as sick leave.

## Titli's Take

Titli Foundation has always been vocal about Menstrual Health and sympathizes with all menstruators. It's high time the workplace stops making it a hush-hush topic and starts implementing policies or providing basic necessities favoring their employees who menstruate. This creates a judgement-free environment where menstruators don't hesitate to talk about their cycle.

When workplaces acknowledge periods, everyone benefits. It’s time to close the leaky ceiling.
